Homographio

A cooperative two-player LAN game where both players are shown different images that contain the same homograph, and must collaborate (via live chat) to enter the correct word and advance.

🎮 Overview

In Homographio, each player connects over LAN. Both players see an image—but the images differ. The catch: both images hint at the same word (a homograph: a word spelled the same but with different meanings). For example:

Player A sees a “lead” (metal)

Player B sees someone “lead”ing a group
Both must type the same word (“lead”) to progress.
Meanwhile, a chat box at the bottom of the screen allows them to coordinate, discuss clues, or share hints in real-time.

Key Features

🖼 Two different images per round, one for each player.

🧠 Both images point to the same homograph.

🗨 Live chat box at the bottom of the screen for collaboration, hinting, and strategizing together.

Simple LAN connection: one player hosts, the other joins.

Rapid rounds to keep the game flowing and encourage teamwork.

How to Play

Host: One player starts the game and waits for the other to join via LAN.

Join: The other player enters the host’s address to connect.

Once both players are connected, a round begins:

Each player sees a unique image.

They assess their clue and chat with their partner to deduce the correct homograph.

Both must enter the same word to progress to the next round.

Repeat rounds until the session ends (optional: timed round, score keeping, etc.).

Use the chat box to discuss hints, guess together, or just have fun.
